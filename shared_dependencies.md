1. React: All the JavaScript files will share the React library as a dependency for creating the components and the app.

2. ReactDOM: Used in "src/index.js" for rendering the app.

3. Web3: Used in "src/services/web3.js" for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It will be imported in "src/App.js" and possibly in other components that need to interact with the blockchain.

4. Polybase: Used in "src/services/polybase.js" for storing data. It will be imported in "src/App.js" and possibly in other components that need to store data.

5. Dynamic SDK: Used in "src/services/dynamicSDK.js" for authentication. It will be imported in "src/App.js" and possibly in other components that need authentication.

6. HashGenerator: Used in "src/utils/hashGenerator.js" for generating hash ids. It will be imported in "src/components/HashId.js" and possibly in other components that need to generate hash ids.

7. UserName and HashId: These are the names of the components that will be used in "src/App.js". They will also be exported from "src/components/UserName.js" and "src/components/HashId.js" respectively.

8. App: This is the main component that will be exported from "src/App.js" and used in "src/index.js".

9. id names: The DOM elements in the components UserName and HashId might have id names for JavaScript functions to use. These id names will be shared between the component files and the files where the functions are defined.

10. Message names: If the app uses messages for communication between components or services, these message names will be shared between the files where the messages are sent and received.

11. Function names: The names of the functions defined in the service and utility files will be shared with the files where these functions are imported and used.

12. Environment Variables: If the app uses environment variables, these will be defined in ".env" and shared with the files that use them.

13. Package.json: This file will contain the names and versions of all the dependencies shared by the JavaScript files.

14. .gitignore: This file will contain the names of files and directories that are shared by the project but should be ignored by Git.
